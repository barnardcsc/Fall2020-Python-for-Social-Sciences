# Python For The Social Scientist World Happiness Report Fall 2020
An introductory workshop on using Python and Pandas to explore and visualize data for the social sciences, using data from the World Happiness Report. This guide is adapted from the CSC Data Analysis for Social Science workshop about age members of Congress. That workshop was adapted from the earlier version designed by Yasmine Kaya (BC '19), based on the Empirical Reasoning Center's intro to excel for data analysis workshop.

The workshop covers the basics of Python, importing CSV formatted data, using Pandas to work with data, pivot tables, and plot style.
